#Roadmap

what currently needs working

function
```
void printSchedule(string schedule[], int arraySize, int employeeLoopTime)

```
- need to figure out how to actually use the information to make a schedule

Input Validation 
- specifically in the different function that gain information

#Information gained from project
- Segmentation failure
- fileText.find(" ");
- string::npos
- while(getline(fileText, text))
- pointers and an array of pointer 
- Could have used structs to get the information of the employee (role, skillset, availability, etc.)
